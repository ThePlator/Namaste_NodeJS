# Introduction to NodeJS

**"Any application that can be written in JavaScript, Will eventually be written in JavaScript."**

**--Jeff Atwood**

### Q: What is Node.JS?

_Node.Js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS and more. Node.Js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a Web Browser._

1. Node.js is s JavaScript runtime built **Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine**.
2. It is maintained by the **OpenJS** foundation.
3. Node.Js allow JavaScript to be executed **outside of the web browser**.

   > This means that while JavaScript is traditionally associated with the web and browser, Node.Js extends its reach, allowing you to run JavaScript code on servers. desktops, and even embedded systems. This is why Node.js is often described with the phrase "Run JavaScript Everywhere."

4. Node.js features an **Event-driven architechture** and supports to **asynchronus I/O(non-blocking I/O)**.

## History of Node.JS

- **2009**: Node.js was created by Ryan Dahl and first released.
- To run the JS, you always need an **JS engine**.
- Everywhere you write JS code, There is an JS engine, That executes the code.
- Ryan started with the **Spider-Monkey JS Engine**, which is found on firefox. but in 2 days he tried using **V8** and never looked back.
- earlier, Ryan was working independently, but there was a company named **Joyent**, and this company was working on something similar to NodeJS. and they hire Ryan to work under us, we will fund your project. big contribution to Joyent Company.
- The earlier name of Node.JS was **Web.JS**, but Ryan later renamed it to **Node.JS** because it was inteded to be used for more than just web servers.
- **Apache HTTP server** was blocking server, so Ryan wanted to create a non-blocking sever, which is why **Node.js** is a non-blocking I/O. The advantage of a non-blocking sever is that it can handle multiple requests with a smaller number of threads.
- **2010**: NPM (Node Package Manager) was introduced to manage Node.js packages.
- **2011**: Node.js gained popularity and started being used by major companies.
- Initially, Node.js was built only for macOS and Linux, but in **2011**, it gained support for Microsoft Windows as well.
- **2012** :**Isaac Z. Schlueter** began maintaining Node.js; he is also the creator of **NPM**.
- **2014**: A developer named **Fedor** created a fork of Node.js called **io.js**, which led to controversy within the company. As a result, 3 to 4 developers began maintaining the io.js branch
- **2015**: **Node.js Foundation** was created to accelerate development.
- In **September 2015, Node.js and io.js** were merged, and the combined project
  was named the **Node.js Foundation**
- **2019**: **Node.js** merged with the **JS Foundation** to form the **OpenJS Foundation**.
- **2020**: Node.js 14 was released with new features and improvements.
